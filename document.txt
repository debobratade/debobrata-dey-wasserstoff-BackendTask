Install necessary dependencies using npm:  npm install express request nodemon

Steps 1 and 2:

- Set up a basic server to function as a load balancer on port 5000.
- Establish backend servers that will operate on ports 3000, 3001, 3002 and 3003.
- Develop middleware to forward requests using a tunnel pipe and create a ServerIndex.
- Implement the Round Robin algorithm to identify and maintain a list of active servers.


Step 3:

- Conduct health checks at 5-second intervals.
- Update backend servers to include a health check API at /live.
- Send a request to the health check API every 5 seconds.
